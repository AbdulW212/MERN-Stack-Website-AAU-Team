AAU Team MERN Stack Website

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack. It provides CRUD functionality and utilizes models, controllers, routes, and utility functions to structure and manage data.

Features Used
MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage the applications data. It offers a flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution.

Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications, which handles routing, middleware, and more.

React.js:A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which enables the creation of interactive and dynamic UI components for the frontend of the application.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It powers the backend of the application and enables server-side logic.

CRUD Functionality: The application supports CRUD operations allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data stored in the MongoDB database.

Models: Used to define the structure and behavior of data entities within the application. They provide a schema for MongoDB documents and facilitate data validation and manipulation.

Controllers: Controllers contain the logic to handle incoming requests, process data, and send responses back to the client. They act as an intermediary between the routes and the models.

Routes: Routes define the endpoints and HTTP methods that clients can use to interact with the server. They map incoming requests to the appropriate controller functions.

Backend Components: Backend components encapsulate reusable logic and functionality that is shared across different parts of the application. They promote code organization and maintainability.

Pages: Pages represent the different views or screens of the application that users can navigate to. They are built using React components and define the layout and structure of the UI.

Utils: Utility functions provide common functionality that can be reused throughout the application, which help in performing tasks such as data fetching, and validation.
